PERL libraries used by my other Perl code, or of general use. Always strict and -w. These tend to be older, I now work mainly in Python.

sjdUtils.pm-- This underlies lots of stuff, and is almost entirely API-compatible
with sjdUtil.py (in PYTHONLIBS).

ColorManager.pm-- Gives easy access to ANSI terminal color

DomExtensions.pm--

ElementManager.pm--

EntityManager.pm--

Tokenizer.pm-- A pretty good NLP text tokenizer. Especially good at Unicode
punctuation and normalization issues.

XmlOutput.pm-- Utility for generating well-formed XML from programs.
Straightforward methods like OpenElement(name, attrs), but maintains the
stack of what's open, so it can close down to a given element by names, tell
you how many of some element type are open, report if you try to close something
not open, etc. It also handles text and attribute escaping. There is an
almost-identical XmlOutput.py under PYTHONLIBS.

XmlTuples.pm-- Support for XML files conforming to a tiny schema suitable for
CSV-like data. Nice because (unlike CSV) you can see what all the fields are,
and you can apply the whole XML suite of tools. Easy to get to/from CSV,
using the TabularFormats package.

alogging.pm-- a simple logging package that support *nix-style "-v" levels,
automatic message indentation, color (see ColorManager.pm and .py), etc.

cp1252.pm-- Quick access to information about Windows Code Page 1252, which
is like Latin-1 except that it uses the C1 control characters (0x80 through 0x9F)
as printables (mostly punctuation and accented Latin vowels). Note that Web
servers often tell you they're giving you Unicode, when they actually are
giving you cp1252.


==Secondary

ArgParse.pm-- Unfinished port of Python argparse.
